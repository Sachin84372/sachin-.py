    #range() function in python

    
#the range in the for loop help  to print the number one by one #
for number in range (10):

#this "5" in the range was showing that they give the diffrent of 5 number betwwen the range#
for num in range (1,20,5):

#using the simple for loop in the pyhon 
for naam in ("computer science"):
