list.append("ashdah")  # it help to add
list.pop(4) # it remove the item {it delete the rohit because this in the index number 3}

list[5]="python"   # it help to remove older one and add the new one 

list=tuple(tum) ### we agin change the list into the tuple ###

print(tum) # it  give the output in tuple
print(list)  # it  give the output in list
